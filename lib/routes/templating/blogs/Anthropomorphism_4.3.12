I knew there was a word for what happens when you assign human like qualities to non human things. I looked it up and it turned out that word is called anthropomorphism.

It's fun to give a lamp or a pair of socks human like qualities.  I laughed out loud at this recent article in the NY Times magazine on a woman and her daughter refusing to get rid of their trash can becuase they just couldn't let go of an object that they had come to treat as an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/magazine/the-secret-life-of-our-trash-can.html?_r=0">old friend.</a>

But as funny and well written as the article was, I couldn't help dwelling on how nostalgia actually prevented the characters from thinking rationally about how to responsibly get rid of their trash can. The last thing I want to do is argue against nostalgia or any sort of fun with regards to anthropomorphism, but rather explore the idea of redirecting these warm feelings towards a better way of throwing away.

If you loved a trash can, would you really want to cover it up with duck tape just to get a few more months out of it? Or could you potentially still keep the magic alive by searching for a new "home" for the trash can, or finding a creative new use of what you might be able to do with the frame(such as a compost bin, hockey goal, etc...).

In addition to completely inanimate objects, few of us are complete strangers to anthropomorphism in the context of animals. I think there are valuable lessons of how we treat animals that can be applied to how we handle our interation with physical objects.

When I was in pre-school our family got our first dog, who was named Midnight given the color of her fur. From what I remember she was great, but she bolted off at every opportunity. Given our location in a suburban town with variable levels of traffic, my parents struggled with whether keeping Midnight was the right decision. Ultimately, they searched around for farms upstate where she would have a chance to roam through fields, and found her a new home.

I think it was because, not in spite of, our love for Midnight that we were able to let her go to a place where she would be happier. The decision was a nice example of emotional and rational factors combining to produce the right outcome for us and our dog.

Ultimately with Wampum and materials reuse, I'm interested in finding this intersection of emotional and rational factors that strike a chord with people to change how we acquire and dispose of material things. Anthropomorphism is an intersting thing, and there is definitely something very human about projecting our own qualities through our imagination. But how can we harness these dreamlike qualities to make better decisions for ourselves and the environment? For me, the example of Midnight tought me that if you love something, sometimes you have to be ready to let it go.
