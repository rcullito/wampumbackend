I actually was pretty intruigied by this show when it first came out, albeit feeling a bit guilty that it was so entertaining and sad at the same time to see people who were literally entrenched amidst all of the useless stuff that they had accumulated over a life time. But in defense of Hoarders, as well as the A & E network, I feel as though the show has appeal because we possess some of the qualities of the show's protagonists, even if they happen to be in smaller quantities.

I knew there was a word for what happens when you assign human like qualities to non human things. I looked it up and it turned out that word is called anthropomorphism.

It's fun to give a lamp or a pair of socks human like qualities. But I have been wondering recently if this practice, while infinitely entertaining, might actually be working against a good approach to materials reuse? I laughed out loud at this recent article in the NY Times magazine on a woman and her daughter refusing to get rid of their trash can becuase they just couldn't let go of an object that they had come to treat as an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/magazine/the-secret-life-of-our-trash-can.html?_r=0">old friend.</a>

It's an abstract thing, but it's interesting to brainstorm about how anthropomorphism(assigning human like qualities to non human things... I had to look it up) might be used to combat nostaliga and actually could encourage better materials reuse practices. 

When I was in pre-school our family got our first dog, who was named Midnight given the color of her fur. From what I remember she was great, but she bolted off at every opportunity. Given our location in a suburban town with variable levels of traffic, my parents struggled with whether keeping Midnight was the right decision. Ultimately, they searched around for farms upstate where she would have a chance to roam through fields, and found her a new home.

While we loved Midnight, we had to recognize that she was trying to return back to some kind of original state of being where she truly belonged. This pattern is also true on an atomic level, things build up and coalesce, but they also break down given enough time. We either ignore this process or we deal with it as quickly as possible. Namely we hold on to things until they are utterly battered and then we put them in landfills. The same nostalgia that kept us from getting rid of our things and being hoarders in the first place paradoxically dictates that some day everything will just be ripped away by an unfeeling host of an A & E show. 

If we could think humanely about our items for a second, wouldn't it be better to start thinking about the end of their life, before they are rendered completely useless?
