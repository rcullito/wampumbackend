It would be interestign if an outdoor company offered a subscription plan for clothing(maybe a pivot for Wampum.io someday??).

start getting kibana screenshots as part of seattle application

basically building and index for the first time of where secondhand and old products are being accumulated, and where they are being shipped to.


include in application the ability to be in seattle and potentially partner with amazon shipment and fullfillment, etc...

// one advantage of sending to wampum could be that you organize everything in one package, and you know where it will be sent from there.
// rather than sending multiple packages with jeans/earphones etc... and wasting a lot on packaging.
// you have one order box from wampum that is returned to you, or you request one prior to sending your stuff out.

Last time around I was working on a product that would only be of use if everyone was on it.
Now my focus has been to build something that will work whether there is one person using it or 1,000. and am hoping to evolve it over time.

There are a lot of one time drives for niche items, such as umbrellas, but few organizations that consistently accep them. Wampum could have warehouse space that helps liquidate things in this area.

Many shelters have limimted storage space. or don't have the resources to provide free shipping like better world books does.

// Search Results

// if there are no results, then ask if you know what your "blank is made out of"

What would make searching easier?

1. autocomplete! have this be a prefix of just the tagged fields.
2. if iphone size or extra small do a shorter width on the go button and no placeholder text.
3. highlight the word that was searched for. add a bluish grey background and white text.
4. look into a build process whereby we can automatically make a new iphone app version! also good for file organization around animation service.
5 have y amplitude adjusted to screen width also(should be in general proportion to what will look good.)
