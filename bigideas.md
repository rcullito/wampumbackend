It would be interestign if an outdoor company offered a subscription plan for clothing(maybe a pivot for Wampum.io someday??).

start getting kibana screenshots as part of seattle application

basically building and index for the first time of where secondhand and old products are being accumulated, and where they are being shipped to.


include in application the ability to be in seattle and potentially partner with amazon shipment and fullfillment, etc...

Thoughts

A lot of big companies can affor their own well managed recyling programs. These seem to focus heavily on electronics. 

Perks. 
1. Pre paid mailing labels. 
2. Really clear as to whether they accept items
3. Customer support so that you can talk to someone.

use notes from 5.2.14 to finish strong.

Work being done

// emailing specific organizations because information is not transparent on their site. 

what they accept, when they are open, is the organization even still around if the site was last updated in 2012??

Issues

car will match card and cartridge, etc...
need to highlight which words matched the search result
look into changing prefix query.


include this appplication and note that in early prototyping electronics has been a big thing that people are searching for.

include choice ted talk link. importan that there always be a TOP hit for what someone should do, just like there is a top result on Google, or netflix, or cheapest price on kayak.

// one advantage of sending to wampum could be that you organize everything in one package, and you know where it will be sent from there.
// rather than sending multiple packages with jeans/earphones etc... and wasting a lot on packaging.
// you have one order box from wampum that is returned to you, or you request one prior to sending your stuff out.

// problems with about.com or oprah, their revenue model is built around advertising. example

Last time around I was working on a product that would only be of use if everyone was on it.
Now my focus has been to build something that will work whether there is one person using it or 1,000. and am hoping to evolve it over time.


// THIS PART IS REALLY FUCKING IMPORTANT

There are a lot of one time drives for niche items, such as umbrellas, but few organizations that consistently accep them. Wampum could have warehouse space that helps liquidate things in this area.

Many shelters have limimted storage space. or don't have the resources to provide free shipping like better world books does.

// Search Results

// if there are no results, then ask if you know what your "blank is made out of"

What would make searching easier?

1. autocomplete! have this be a prefix of just the tagged fields.
still to do
css stuff
search on enter

- worry about ordering of suggestions and searches in general once we have search data

2. if iphone size or extra small do a shorter width on the go button and no placeholder text.
3. highlight the word that was searched for. add a bluish grey background and white text.
4. look into a build process whereby we can automatically make a new iphone app version! also good for file organization around animation service. have this push out code to the instace
5 have y amplitude adjusted to screen width also(should be in general proportion to what will look good.)
6. return to event collection
7. get kibana and marvel going
8. start tracking database versions in lothlorien or better yet start storing in s3, and hook up with transmit
